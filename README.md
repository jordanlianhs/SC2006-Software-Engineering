JFC aims to create an application that predicts future prices of HDB resale flats in Singapore. This would benefit potential house-buyers by providing insights for the best time to buy or sell a resale flat, or if they are interested to compare between future house prices.

# Product Perspective
Our product is a web application designed for homebuyers and home investors to search, view and track resale flats in the Singapore market. The application fetches data from data.gov.sg and uses machine learning models to predict future resale prices via Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs. This application is a standalone product, but it will be integrated with external data sources and may potentially interface with other real estate platforms.

# Product Functions
<ul>
  <li>User Account (Login, Registration, Reset Password, My Profile and Change User Profile)</li>
  <li>Search for resale flats based on various parameters</li>
  <li>Display detailed information about selected resale flats</li>
  <li>Display price prediction graphs for resale flats</li>

# To run the code
Ensure that you have virtual environment on python along with nodejs and yarn installed

There is a need to open two terminal, one for backend one for frontend

For backend:
1. `cd SC2006 `
2. activate virtual environment for your OS 
2a. For Windows<br />
` virtualenv env`<br />
` env\scripts\activate ` <br />
`cd jfcbackend` <br />
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br />
`python manage.py runserver` <br />

2b. For mac<br />
`create virtualenv â€˜venv'` <br />
`source env/bin/activate` <br />
`cd jfcbackend` <br />
`pip install -r requirements-mac.txt` <br />
`python3 manage.py runserver ` <br />

For frontend:<br />
1. `cd SC2006`
2. `cd jfcproperty`
